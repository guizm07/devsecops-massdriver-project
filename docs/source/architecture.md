This page covers the project's architecture.

It is written in Markdown, for your convenience.


```{note}
Because this file is linked in the `docs/source/index.rst` table of content tree (toctree), it will be ingested as part of the docs.
From there, it will be processed by `myst_parser` into ReSructuredText (RST), then interpreted by Sphinx into HTML. Checkout [myst_parser's docs](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for details of the integration and possibilities.
Other than these details, normal markdown rules apply.
